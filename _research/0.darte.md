# The Scoop On Poop: Connecting Manure Management To Antimicrobial Resistance

The global spread of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) organisms and spread of AMR-associated genes poses a serious threat to the safety of our food and public health while being responsible for increased hospitalization and mortality of both humans and production animals.  The release of AMR genes and organisms and microbes in the environment from agricultural sources is considered a serious threat but little is known about their persistence and spread in the environment.  


Elevated levels of resistant bacteria and resistance genes are finding their way into the environment through the land application of manure associated with animal production facilities. We propose to combat AMR in these systems by: developing improved tools to better indicate AMR risk in agroecosystems, identifying the best practices for mitigating AMR during manure storage and treatment, and providing a better understanding of how AMR develops during swine manure management. Our results will be directly communicated to producers and stakeholders through our long-standing manure management extension programs. Specifically, we propose to achieve the following research objectives, all of which are integrated into an extension objective to communicate research results with our partners.

# Connecting Antimicrobial Resistance, Agricultural Decisions, And Environmental Systems (CAMRADES)

Our project will inform the effectiveness of mitigation strategies in reducing risk to human
health in agro-ecosystems by developing an adaptable framework, CAMRADES. We will
integrate predictive models of AMR transport and associated risk to human health, and improve
stakeholder understanding of AMR, potential risks and mitigation strategies. Our framework integrates detection of antibiotics, AMR genes and indicator organisms and
exposure pathways in the environment with hydrologic and water quality monitoring. A key
output of this effort will be a predictive model of antibiotic and AMR sources, fate, and
transport, which will be integrated with a novel risk assessment
