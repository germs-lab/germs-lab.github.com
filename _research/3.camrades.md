# Connecting Antimicrobial Resistance, Agricultural Decisions, And Environmental Systems (CAMRADES)

Our project will inform the effectiveness of mitigation strategies in reducing risk to human
health in agro-ecosystems by developing an adaptable framework, CAMRADES. We will
integrate predictive models of AMR transport and associated risk to human health, and improve
stakeholder understanding of AMR, potential risks and mitigation strategies. Our framework integrates detection of antibiotics, AMR genes and indicator organisms and
exposure pathways in the environment with hydrologic and water quality monitoring. A key
output of this effort will be a predictive model of antibiotic and AMR sources, fate, and
transport, which will be integrated with a novel risk assessment
