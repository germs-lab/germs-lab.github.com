# Become one of the GERMS! #

We take an interdisciplinary approach to understand and manage natural and engineering microbial systems.  We are interested in combining molecular approaches and biological sequencing data to study complex microbial communities.  We are also interested in sustainable scientific data/software development practices.  We are interested in working with microbiologists, computer scientists, engineers, physicists, and more.  

If you are interested in joining GERMS as a graduate student, you should apply to the ISU graduate program in [Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering](http://www.abe.iastate.edu/prospective-students/apply-today/), [Environmental Science](http://www.ensci.iastate.edu/grad/applying.html), [Interdepartmental Microbiology Program](http://www.micro.iastate.edu/), or [Bioinformatics and Computational Biology](http://www.bcb.iastate.edu/Prospect.html#Apply).    

# Postdocs Wanted! #

We are seeking full time, 12-month postdoctoral associate positions to conduct research on microbial activity and function in soil and water ecosystems.  The position will focus on the characterization of specific microbial communities and genes in agricultural systems, their interactions with other microbial members and genes, and the effects of environmental factors on their movement and activities.  The position will support development of bioinformatic pipelines, data collection, analysis, and communication with various projects being conducted by the GERMS Lab.

Preferred Education:  Knowledge and experience in soil and water quality monitoring;  knowledge and experience in environmental microbiogy or relevant area; knowledge and experience in microbial ecology and application of sequencing technologies; a record of scholarly publications; a demonstrated record of working in multi-disciplinary teams.

To apply, send a CV and a cover letter describing your research interests and fit for the lab with the subject "GERMSLab Website Postdoc" to adina@iastate.edu.  Please include references that may be contacted in your application material.
