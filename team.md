# Our Code of Conduct

The guiding principle of our lab is to advance science, tools, and software through our research.  We recognize that we are a team and that our success is determined by both individual and collective efforts. We are all caretakers of our reputation, and how we perform our research, our coursework, and our collaborations reflects on ourselves and each other. Each of us is personally responsible for supporting our core values of creating a welcoming culture; delivering our very best; being present; and acting with integrity.

GERMS is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of lab members in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any lab venue, including lab meetings, presentations, or discussions.
